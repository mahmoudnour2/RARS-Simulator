# RARS-Simulator
A RARS simulator to simulate RISC-V programs.
A RARS simulator to simulate RISC-V programs. The simulator uses registers, PC counter, stack, instruction memory, data memory, to imitate the result as well as the behavior of the execution of the instructions in the computer

Intense validations are implemented & relevant error messages are printed to the user in case an error has been reached.

Instructions to use the program and benefit from:
1-Create a text file and include your RISC-V code (Note that the format of the code has to be such that between every comma there is a blank space.)
2-Include the file path in lines 1193 and 1206. 
3-Create a text file and inlcude your data in the following format--> address,data
4-Include the file path in line 107
5-Compile the code
