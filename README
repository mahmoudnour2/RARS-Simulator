This project is a RARS simulator to simulate RISC-V assembly code.
Intense validations are implemented & relevant error messages are printed to the user in case an error has been reached.

Instructions to use the program and benefit from:
1-Create a text file and include your RISC-V code (Note that the format of the code has to be such that between every comma there is a blank space.)
2-Include the file path in lines 1193 and 1206. 
3-Create a text file and inlcude your data in the following format--> address,data
4-Include the file path in line 107
5-Compile the code
